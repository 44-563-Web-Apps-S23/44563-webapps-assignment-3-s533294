        <h1>Carter Smith</h1>
        <p>My Name is Carter Smith, I am from Liberty, MO. I am a CS student. 
            In my free time I really enjoy spending time with family and friends, watching football and college basketball, 
            as well as fixing/learning anything technical.

        <h2>Into the Wild</h2>
        <p>I enjoy the way the novel is written, like a journal documenting the life of Chris McCandless.
            I also enjoy the themes present in the book, especially relating to self-reliance, rugged individualism,
            materialism, freedom and trancendentalism.
